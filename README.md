# House-Rent-Prediction-with-LSTM
I used house rent dataset from Kaggle in this project. There are 12 columns. Details can be seen in the notebook. Preprocessing the dataset There are no missing values. Area Type, City, Furniture Status, Tenant Preferred fields convert string to integer using map function. Build the Model I used LSTM in this project. This model has 4 layers 2 of them LSTM layers, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. I used Adam as an optimizer and Mean Squarred Error as an Loss Function. I used 1 batch size and 21 epochs. Evaluate the model After training the model, Loss value was 4774934016. According to the Mean Squared Error, the minimum loss value is the best. It can be build another model and it can be compared loss values.
